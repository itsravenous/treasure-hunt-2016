    <h1>Welcome to P.I.E.</h1>
    <p>Congratulations!  You have been selected for mandatory recruitment as a downstream agent.</p>

    <p>Your first mission is to recover a delivery of Time Cubes.  They have been sent to the next available interval following this message.</p>
    <p>We are watching you closely.  P.I.E. needs agents who are observant, quick-thinking and competitive.</p>
    <p>Information: Time Cube technology is strongly tied to geometry.  It therefore has an affinity with <em>corners</em>.  For this mission we have identified corners where a good agent can easily find them - without breaking their cover, by having to behave too suspiciouslly.</p>
    <p>Intelligence: There may be other downstream agents using this location.</p>
